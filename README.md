MusicMap is a visual way to explore 5,000+ genres and over 500,000
songs! Scroll to zoom and click to drag across the map. Once you're
ready, select a genre and listen to 30 second samples of that genre.

Generally, the type of genres are organized by color and location.
Blue describes instrumentals. Pink describes
electronic music/EDM. Orange genres are rock. Red genres are
metal. Green and Yellow genres describe everything from indie to
pop. Genres closer together sound similar while genres further away
sound less similar.

Some other features...
Refresh Map: Get a new map of 400 genres of the pool 5000+
Search: Look for a specific genre within app
Dance Mode: Makes the genre nodes dance!
Spotify Search: Searches for specific genre on Spotify
Shuffle Random Genre: Changes the genre after each sample
Skip: Skips current sample

MusicMap is built in ReactJS, Material-UI, Recharts, and
React-Map-Interaction. The data was gathered by using a scrapping
tool on https://everynoise.com/. This app was designed primarily for desktop but also 
works well on mobile.

Thanks so much for visiting my app! I hope you find this app as
fun as I did making it. I really can not understate
how much I appreciate it, especially as a budding web/software developer :)
