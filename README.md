MusicMap is a visual way to explore 5000+ genres! Scroll to zoom and
click to drag across the map. Once you're ready, select a genre and
listen to a 30 second sample. Refreshing the map repicks 400 genres
of the 5000+. Shuffle queues a random song for as long as it's toggled.

Generally, the type of genres are organized by color and location.
Blue genres are typically instrumentals. Pink genres describe
electronic music/EDM. Orange genres are mainly rock. Red
genres are metal. Green and Yellow genres describe everything from
indie to pop. Genres closer together sound similar while genres
further away sound less similar.

When you find a genre you really like, you can lookup "The Sound of
-insert-genre-here-" on Spotify, where there's an awesome playlist ready for you.
To listen to all the genres at once, checkout https://open.spotify.com/playlist/69fEt9DN5r4JQATi52sRtq.

MusicMap is built in ReactJS, Recharts, Material-UI, React-Map-Interaction. The data was
gathered by using a scrapping tool on https://everynoise.com/.

App works well on both DESKTOP and MOBILE :)
