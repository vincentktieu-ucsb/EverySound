MusicMap is a visual way to explore 5,000+ genres and over 500,000 songs!
Scroll to zoom and click to drag across the map. Once you're ready, select a genre
and listen to 30 second samples of that genre.

Generally, the type of genres are organized by color and location.
Blue genres are typically instrumentals. Pink genres describe
electronic music/EDM. Orange genres are mainly rock. Red genres are
metal. Green and Yellow genres describe everything from indie to
pop. Genres closer together sound similar while genres further away
sound less similar.

Other actions you can perform are to refresh the map, search for genre playlist on
Spotify, shuffle random genres, and skip your current sample.
Refreshing provides 400 new genres on your map. Shuffle random genre changes the genre
after each sample. There are 100+ unique samples for each genre.

MusicMap is built in ReactJS, Recharts, Material-UI, React-Map-Interaction. The data was
gathered by using a scrapping tool on https://everynoise.com/.

App works well on both DESKTOP and MOBILE :)
